Connect the JTAG cable
----------------------

Looking from board edge: red, yellow, purple, white, green

If iMPACT can't see cable, make sure the parallel port is enabled in the BIOS (e.g. mode 278). Then, play around with addresses and drivers. Usually, something will work. Good luck!


To actually program the flash
-----------------------------

Open iMPACT
Configure devices using Boundary-Scan (JTAG): Automatically...
Bypass bit file
Device Programming Properties -> just click OK
Right-click chip, Add SPI/BPI Flash
Select pdq.mcs
SPI PROM, AT45DB161D
Right-click flash -> Program

Will count up to 23%, stop & blue LED on board goes off, then say "Program Succeeded" and the blue LED relights
